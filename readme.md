## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Kinetica.git
cd Kinetica
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

**Create a virtual environment**

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

**Activate the environment**
On macOS and Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt.
requirements.txt

```
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
noise
```

Install them using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run an Animation

To see an animation, simply run any of the individual scripts. A window will pop up showing the live animation.

```
python3 double_pendulum.py
```
