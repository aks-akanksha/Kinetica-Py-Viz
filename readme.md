Python Animation Collection
A curated collection of visually captivating animations created with Python's matplotlib and numpy. This repository showcases a wide range of concepts, from chaotic physics and cellular automata to mathematical art and pathfinding algorithms.

Animations Included
Black Hole Accretion Disk: An enhanced simulation of particles orbiting a central gravitational body, now featuring powerful relativistic jets.

Double Pendulum: A classic demonstration of chaotic motion, where the path is highly sensitive to initial conditions. (A personal favorite!)

Conway's Game of Life: A faster, more populated cellular automaton, seeded with multiple classic patterns like the "Gosper Glider Gun" and "Pulsars".

Wave Interference: An improved visualization of how two wave sources interact, with a more pleasing color scheme.

Sorting Algorithm: A fixed and clearer, color-coded representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in action.

Barnsley Fern: A beautiful fractal generated using an iterated function system (IFS).

Fourier Epicycles: An advanced animation that uses Fourier series to draw a complex shape (the letter 'G') with rotating vectors.

*A Pathfinding:** A sped-up and polished visualization of the A* search algorithm finding the shortest path on a grid with obstacles.

Reaction-Diffusion: A stunning simulation of the Gray-Scott model, now tuned to produce mesmerizing "mitotic" patterns that resemble cell division.

Perlin Noise Flow Field: An animation where thousands of particles trace paths through a smoothly-varying, randomly generated vector field.

Animated 3D Surface: A dynamic 3D plot of a rippling surface that rotates over time.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
You need Python 3 installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

Running the Animations
To run any of the animations, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the desired script with Python:

# Example: To run the double pendulum simulation
python double_pendulum.py

# To run the new Reaction-Diffusion simulation
python reaction_diffusion.py

Feel free to explore the code, tweak the parameters at the top of each file, and see how it changes the final result!

I'll keep updating more animations to this list!!!
