üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or newer installed on your system.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Kinetica.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Kinetica.git)
cd Kinetica

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install Dependencies
The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt.

# requirements.txt
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
noise

Install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run an Animation
To see an animation, simply run any of the individual scripts. A window will pop up showing the live animation.

python3 double_pendulum.py

üîß Project Structure
Animation Scripts (.py): Each file (e.g., lorenz_attractor.py) is a self-contained script that generates a specific animation.

animation_outputs: You can see sample outputs here!
